        <p>I am not one to talk much about myself or my interests (OpSec) but, I find it interesting how people</p><br /> 
           acrost all cultures choose to <strong>defy control</strong> over thier persons. Some are <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarchy>anarchists</a>, others may lean <br />
           more towards libertarianism. No matter their political leaning though, they tend to believe <strong>only</strong> <br />
           in actions allowed by/on their persons by themselves. As a person raised within whichever society <br />
           they were born in, or chose to move to, still resist complying with the actions of that society. I <br />
           find it even more so entertaining when it takes the form of meme status, particularly when teh subject is <br />
           a child. Typically being a person incapable of understanding the conditions/choices one makes to lead <br />
           them to the point of being <strong>anarchical</strong>.</p>
